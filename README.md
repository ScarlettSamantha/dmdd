# DMDD

## Choices

> Q: Why choose for both python and php
>
> > A: because php does not do threading (well), so its way easier to just have a python daemon running and doing some RPC.

> Q: Why is it split up the way it is
>
> > A: Mostly because of the demo assignment thing but also because the subject matter the application deal with and most of the core logic needing to be detachable to defere liability and it keeps the core re-usable for other projects later on.
